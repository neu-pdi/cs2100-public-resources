# Course Overview and Python

## Understand the structure of this course and its learning outcomes, and expectations for students

## See the locations of relevant resources

## Describe the purpose of our practices for code-level design (style guidlines)

### Why enfore a Style Guide?
- Helps other people to more easily understand / contribute to existing software
- Companies have conventions that dictate the style of how code is written â€‹
- "Official" Python style guide: [https://peps.python.org/pep-0008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

## Trace Python code which includes types, and understand why it's important to keep track of the types

Your classmate wants help finding a bug in their code:

```
def get_area_of_rectangle(width, height):
    return width * height

width = '3'
height = 4

result = get_area_of_rectangle(width, height)

print(f'Area of a {width} by {height} rectangle: {result}')
```

Its output is `Area of a 3 by 4 rectangle: 3333`, which is false.
Wouldn't it be nice if the IDE could save us a bit of time finding the bug?

Python is a strongly typed language, which means that variables have types.
Python is also a dynamically typed language, which means that it checks the types for consistency at run time, not compile time.
We love Python, but being a strongly typed and dynamically typed language can make it hard for introductory learners -- and make it hard to catch bugs in code that we haven't seen before.

Python supports putting types in the code:

```
def get_area_of_rectangle(width: int, height: int) -> int:
    return width * height

width: int = '3'
height: int = 4

result: int = get_area_of_rectangle(width, height)

print(f'Area of a {width} by {height} rectangle: {result}')
```

By default, Python does not enforce the types. The above code runs exactly as before, even after adding the types.

So, in this course, we will use MyPy to enforce the type checking.

### MyPy Setup

MyPy's documentation can be found at [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.mypy-type-checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.mypy-type-checker)

How to set up the VSCode extension:

1. In VSCode, go to the "Extensions" tab on the left. Search for and install "Mypy Type Checker"
2. Then, go to VSCode's Settings menu
   - Mac: `Code` > `Settings...` > `Settings`  (or `Cmd` + `,`)
   - Windows: `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings`  (or `Ctrl` + `,`)
4. Navigate to Extensions > Mypy Type Checker
5. In the Args section, add two args:
   - --strict
   - --disallow-untyped-defs

Now, any missing or mismatched types will be reported in the "Problems" tab (next to "Output" and "Debug Console").

If MyPy is set up properly, then this code:

```
def add(num1: int, num2) -> int:
    return num1 + num2

result: str = add(3, 'hi')
```

should result in three errors: `num2`'s missing type, `add()`'s returning something other than the promised `int`, and `result`'s value being an `int` when the variable type is `str`.

## Given a problem that has a function-sized solution, write a solution including documentation and tests

## Describe the reasons why Python is popular, and what it mean to "run" Python code
