---

# Interfaces and Abstract Classes

## Understand the purpose of an abstract method
## Understand why interfaces and abstract classes can make less sense in a language that uses duck typing
## Import the ABC module and write an interface and an abstract class
## Write a class which implements an interface
## Reinforce Python contracts, e.g., collections.abc.Sized for len(), collections.abc.Sequence for sorting, collections.abc.Container
