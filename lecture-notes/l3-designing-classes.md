# Designing Classes

## List the three main parts of a class (attributes, methods, constructor)
## Organize tests using unittest.TestCase
## Identify test cases and implement them as unit tests (without knowing the implementation of the function being tested)
## Write well-named and organized tests which help the reader understand the purpose of a function
## Use setup and cleanup
## Handle mutable state in tests
## Use try/accept safely
