# Debugger, Command Line, and Git

## Use the debugger to trace code

Poll: My code keeps printing the wrong thing. What can I do?

1. Run it again – maybe it will magically work this time!
2. Stare at the code for a couple more hours trying random things
3. Use the debugger
4. Nothing – this is unfixable

## Use the command line to navigate the file system: pwd, cd, ls -al
## Use git through the command line: clone, add, commit, push, pull, status
## use tests to debug a function
