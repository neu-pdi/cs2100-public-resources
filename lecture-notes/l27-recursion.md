# Recursion

Recursion: Solving a problem by solving a smaller version of the problem

(The function calls itself to do the smaller version of itself)

## Tracing a recursive function

Let's trace this function:
```python
def power(base: int, exp: int) -> int:
    """Returns the base raised to the power of the exponent"""
    if exp == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        returned = power(base, exp-1)
        return base * returned
        # base ^ exp = base * base ^ (exp-1)
```

Poll: What does this function do?
```python
def something(inp: int) -> int:
    if inp == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        digit = inp % 10
        rest = inp // 10
        return digit + something(rest)
```
1. Returns a number added to itself 10 times
2. Returns the sum of the digits in a number
3. Returns a number added to itself as many times as digits in the number
4. Returns 0

Structure of a recursive function:
- Base case
  - The simplest version of the problem you are trying to solve
  - E.g., 0, empty string, empty list
- Recursive case
  - Do one step
    - E.g., process one number, print one character
  - Recursively call the function to do the rest of the steps

Notes from tracing recursive functions:
- In the debugger, we saw:
  - Call stack: the stack of function calls that are currently running
  - Stack frame:
    - Each function call in the call stack is a stack frame
    - Each stack frame includes its own copy of the variables / parameters

What if no base case?
Let's remove the base case from `something` and trace it!

## Implementing a recursive function

Let's write a recursive function that returns the sum of the numbers in a list. But in this case, â€‹sometimes an element in the list is another list. (We can use the `Any` type to satiate MyPy for this example.)
- Use `isinstance()` to differentiate the case
- Two base cases
  - Empty list (return 0)
  - `None` / not a list (return 0)
- Two recursive cases:
  - First element is a number: add the first element to the sum of the rest of the list
  - First element is a list: sum the elements in that first list and add that to the sum of the rest of the list
```python
def sum_list(inp: List[Any]) -> Any:
    if inp is None or not isinstance(inp, List):
        return 0
    elif len(inp) == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        element = inp[0]
        if isinstance(element, List):
            return sum_list(element) + sum_list(inp[1:])
        else:
            return element + sum_list(inp[1:])

print(sum_list([1, 2, [3, 4], 5]))
```

Poll: What goes in the ??? ? We want the `size()` function to return the size of a string.
```python
def size(inp: str) -> int:
    if inp == '':
        return 0
    else:
        return ???
```
1. `1 + size(inp)`
2. `size(inp)`
3. `0 + size(inp)`
4. `0`

Poll: What goes in the ??? ? We want the `reverse()` function to return the reversed version of the string.
```python
def reverse(inp: str) -> str:
    if inp == '':
        return ???
    else:
        return ???
```
1. `''`, `inp[0] + reverse([1:])`
2. `''`, `reverse(inp[1:]) + inp[0]`
3. `None`, `inp[0] + reverse([1:])`
4. `None`, `reverse(inp[1:]) + inp[0]`

Poll: What goes in the ??? ? We want `reverse_inputs()` to take `n` words from the user and then print them in reverse order.
```python
def reverse_inputs(n: int) -> None:
    """Takes n inputs from the user, and prints them in
    reverse order.
    Example: user types in "cat" "elephant" "fish"
    Output:
       fish
       elephant
       cat"""
    if n > 0:
        ???
```
1.
```python
word = input('Please enter a word: ')
print(word)
reverse_inputs(n - 1)
```

2.
```python
reverse_inputs(n - 1)
word = input('Please enter a word: ')
print(word)
```

4.
```python
word = input('Please enter a word: ')
reverse_inputs(n - 1)
print(word)
```

Exercise: Let's write a recursive function `try_all()` that calls this function using all possible passcodes:
```python
def unlock(passcode: str) -> None:
    """Unlocks the vault if the passcode is correct"""
    if passcode == '0004':
        print("Unlocked!") 
```
```python
def try_all(num_digits: int, passcode_so_far: str = '') -> None:
    if len(passcode_so_far) == num_digits:
        unlock(passcode_so_far)
    else:
        for digit in range(10):
            try_all(num_digits, f'{passcode_so_far}{digit}')
```

## In-class exercise: debate

Do this if few enough students are present. Recommended: between 18 and 81 students

We will split the class into three groups, one for each of the following three problems.

And within each of those three groups, we will split the group further into three sub-groups.

For each of the following three problems:
- One sub-group will argue that we should use a for loop to solve the problem
- One sub-group will argue that we should use a while loop to solve the problem
- One sub-group will argue that we should use recursion to solve the problem

You will have 5 minutes to prepare, and then send two representatives from your group to argue your assigned position. They must argue their assigned position.
You may use any tool to come up with an argument.

### Problem 1: is_palindrome()
The problem: write a function called `is_palindrome()` that takes a string and returns `True` if it is a palindrome (and returns `False` otherwise).
A string is a palindrome if it is the same backwards and forwards.

### Problem 2: greatest_common_denominator()
The problem: write a function called `greatest_common_denominator()` that takes two `int`s and returns the largest integer that is a factor of both `int`s.

### Problem 3: flatten()
The problem: write a function called flatten() which takes a list (where the elements may be lists, or they may be individual things) and returns a "flattened" version of the list (where the elements are not lists, and they must just be the individual things).

Example: `flatten([4, 5, [1, 2, [3]], [0, 6]]) = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 0, 6]`
