# Design patterns: Strategy, Observer, and "Data Pull"

## Design Patterns

This semester, we have already covered a few _design patterns_: structures or templates that software engineers have agreed solve common software problems.

- In [Lecture 11 (Lists)](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs2100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l11-lists#the-accumulator-pattern), we covered the Accumulator Pattern: the pattern that we use to add up, or _accumulate_, a sequence of items.
- We had a few [lectures on design patterns for handling data](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs2100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l15-design-data1), including mapping, filtering, and merging dataframes.

Design patterns are independent of programming language, and they provide us a common vocabulary to communicate "blueprints" for standard patterns with each other.

## "Data Pull" pattern

Modeled after this lecture: https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2024/Slides/Module%2005%20Interaction-Level%20Design%20Patterns.pdf

## Observer pattern

## Strategy pattern

Search algorithms: DFS -> BFS -> A* -> Strategy Pattern

(They have already seen DFS)
