# Sets and Dictionaries

We have already worked with two data structures: Lists and Tuples. Both are ways to keep an ordered collection of elements, all of which are the same type[^1].
Recall from Lecture 9: a tuple is a lot like a list, but it's immutable: its contents cannot be changed after the tuple is initially created.

[^1]: Yes, Python allows us to have different types in the same List or Tuple, but it's discouraged, and MyPy blocks it for us.
