# The Decorator Pattern

## Function Decorators

We have already seen some decorators:
- `@property` (to create a property named after the method)
- `*.setter` (to give that property a "setter" method)
- `@classmethod` (for `setUpClass(cls)` and `tearDownClass(cls)` to run once before / after unit testing)

In this lecture, we will find out how these decorators were implemented, and how we can create our own decorators.

## Functions are objects that can be mutated

As we already know, in Python, [functions are objects](https://neu-pdi.github.io/cs2100-public-resources/lecture-notes/l15-design-data1#functions-are-objects).
We can reference them using variables, store them in lists, and pass them as arguments to other functions:
```python
from typing import Callable

def double(num: int) -> int:
    return num * 2

def triple(num: int) -> int:
    return num * 3

functions: list[Callable[[int], int]] = [double, triple]

def apply_functions(num: int) -> list[int]:
    return [func(num) for func in functions]

print(apply_functions(5))  # [10, 15]
```

## Creating a function decorator

A function decorator is a way to mutate a function to modify what it does.

For example, let's create a decorator called `@time_calls` that modifies a given function to print the time it took to run it like this:
```python
@time_calls
def multiply_list(nums: list[int], multiplier: int = 1) -> list[int]:
    return [num * multiplier for num in nums]

print(multiply_list([i for i in range(5)], multiplier = 3))
```
Because we modified `multiply_list()` to do what `@time_calls` tells it to do, this is the printed output:
```
Executed multiply_list with ([0, 1, 2, 3, 4],) and {'multiplier': 3} in 7.152557373046875e-06ms
[0, 3, 6, 9, 12]
```

This is how we created the `@time_calls` decorator to work like that:
```python
def time_calls(func: Callable[..., Any]) -> Callable[..., Any]:
    def wrapper(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        now = time.time()
        return_value = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f'Executed {func.__name__} with {args} and {kwargs} in {time.time() - now}ms')
        return return_value
    return wrapper
```
We defined a function called `time_calls()` that takes a function as its argument and returns a function.

The function that it returns is a modified version of the function that is passed to it as an argument.

That modification is that, in addition to running the passed function as usual, it prints the number of milliseconds that it took to run it.

All that is needed for the `@time_calls` decorator to work is this definition of the `time_calls()` function (somewhere in the file before the decorator is used).

Poll: What does the `@mystery` decorator do?
```python
T = TypeVar('T')

def mystery(func: Callable[[float], T]) -> Callable[[float], T]:
    def wrapper(x: float) -> T:
        if x < 0:
            raise ValueError("Argument must be positive")
        return func(x)
    return wrapper

@mystery
def square_root(x: float) -> Any:
    return x ** 0.5

print(square_root(9))
```
1. Modifies the function to print the number of milliseconds it took to run it
2. Modifies the function such that it raises a `ValueError` if the argument is negative
3. Modifies the function to run it twice
4. Nothing

## Caching or memoization: a common use of decorators

Memoization, or caching, is temporarily storing values that are recalculated often (so they only need to be calculated once).
For example, consider the function where we find the nth Fibonacci number:
```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
In order to calculate the 5th Fibonacci number, we need to calculate the 4th and 3rd ones.
And to calculate the 4th number, we need to calculate the 3rd and 2nd ones.
And to calculate the 3rd number, we need to calculate the 2nd and 1st ones...
There are a lot of recalculated numbers here.

So, let's write some code that stores each Fibonacci number _the first time it is calculated_, so that each subsequent time, we can just look it up rather than recalculating it.

(Write this example together, then step through it with the debugger)
```python
R = TypeVar('R')

def memoize(func: Callable[..., R]) -> Callable[..., R]:
    cache: dict[tuple[Any, ...], R] = {}
    def wrapper(*args: Any) -> R:
        if args in cache:
            return cache[args]
        result = func(*args)
        cache[args] = result
        return result
    return wrapper

@memoize
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```

Poll: Can we re-use the `@memoize` decorator to perform memoization for other functions in the same file?
1. Yes
2. Yes, but that other function would share the "cache" of stored values, which are specific to Fibonacci
3. No, it would not run

Easiest way to test this: create a duplicate method called `fibonacci2()`, decorate it, call it after the regular `fibonacci()`, and step through it in the debugger.

## Preserving function metadata

Functions have metadata such as their name and docstring:
```python
def double(num: int) -> int:
    """Doubles a number."""
    return num * 2

print(double.__name__)  # double
print(double.__doc__)   # Doubles a number.
```

When we create a decorator that "wraps" a function within another function, its metadata is overwritten by the wrapper's metadata:
```python
def my_decorator(func: Callable[..., Any]) -> Callable[..., Any]:
    def wrapper(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        print("Before calling function")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After calling function")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def double(num: int) -> int:
    """Doubles a number."""
    return num * 2

print(double.__name__)  # wrapper
print(double.__doc__)   # None
```

Luckily, the `functools` module has an easy fix: the `@wraps` decorator.
The `@wraps` decorator takes the metadata from the passed function, and copies it to the wrapper function:
```python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func: Callable[..., Any]) -> Callable[..., Any]:
    @wraps(func)  # This copies func's metadata to wrapper
    def wrapper(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        print("Before calling function")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print("After calling function")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def double(num: int) -> int:
    """Doubles a number."""
    return num * 2

print(double.__name__)  # double
print(double.__doc__)   # Doubles a number.
```

Poll: Why do we use `wraps` from the `functools` package?
1. To copy the metadata from the original (un-decorated) function to the wrapper function that decorates it
2. To copy the metadata from the decorating wrapper function to the original (un-decorated) function
3. To make it so we can use a function as a decorator with the `@` symbol
4. `wraps` is like a type hint: it doesn't do anything and isn't enforced in Python by default

## Class decorators

_Function_ decorators are popular in Python.
However, _class_ decorators are more popular in other languages including Java.

A _class_ decorator is also a decorator that uses the `@` symbol. The only difference is that it decorates a class instead of a function.

Here is an example where we create a class decorator called `@add_logging` that modifies a class's `__init__()` to add a `print()` statement for logging.
(Note that we create the `HasInit` protocol to ensure that we only use the `@add_logging` decorator on classes that have an `__init__()`.)
```python
class HasInit(Protocol):
    def __init__(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ...

C = TypeVar('C', bound=HasInit)

def add_logging(cls: Type[C]) -> Type[C]:
    original_init = cls.__init__
    
    @wraps(original_init)
    def new_init(self: Any, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        print(f"Creating instance of {cls.__name__}")
        original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)
    
    cls.__init__ = new_init  # type: ignore[misc]
    return cls

@add_logging
class User:
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name

user = User('Mini')
```
