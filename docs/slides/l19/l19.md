## Consider this...
We want to create a class for `Cat` (with properties like `claw_sharpness`, and methods like `knead()`).

We also want to create a class for `Lion`, which has all the functionality of `Cat`, but additional things like a `roar()` method.

## Subclasses and superclasses

A _subclass_ (or _child_ class) is a more specific version of a _superclass_ (_parent_ class).

The subclass _inherits_ all the methods and attributes from the _superclass_ and then adds more that are specific to it.

Syntax: when declaring the subclass, put the superclass's name in parentheses:
`class Lion(Cat):​`

---

```python
class Student():
    def __init__(self, student_id: str, major: str):
        self.id = student_id
        self.major = major
        self.courses: Set[str] = set()
    
    def attend_lab(self, course_id: str) -> None:
        if course_id in self.courses:
            print(f'Attending {course_id}\' lab')
    
    def register_courses(self, courses: Set[str]) -> None:
        self.courses |= courses

class UndergraduateStudent(Student):
    def change_major(self, new_major: str) -> None:
        self.major = new_major
```

Only undergrads can switch majors.

---

## Subclasses override methods from their superclasses

A subclass inherits all of the methods and instance variables from its superclass.
- Can add more
  - `UndergraduateStudent` adds `change_major()`
  - `Lion` adds `roar()`
- Can overwrite what it inherits from the superclass
- Actually, it inherits all of the methods and instance variables except those that are named with two underscores.

        self.food = ['tuna', 'chicken']
    
    def knead(self) -> None:
        print('Kneading')

        if food in self.food + ['zebra']:
            print(f'Eating {food}')

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
class Button:
    def __init__(self, fancy: bool):
        self.fancy = fancy

class Shirt:
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.size = size
        self.buttons: list[Button] = []
    
    def add_button(
            self, b: Button
    ) -> None:
        self.buttons.append(b)
    
    def fold(self) -> None:
        print('Folding')
    
class FormalShirt(Shirt):
    def add_button(
            self, b: Button) -> None:
        if b.fancy:
            self.buttons.append(b)
```

</div>
<div>

## Poll: What happens?

```python
s = FormalShirt(500)
s.fold()
```

1. It raises an error
2. Cannot do that - won't run
3. It calls `Shirt`'s `fold()` method
4. It does nothing

</div>
</div>

---

## Using `super()`

Look for the redundancy:

```python
class Shirt:
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.size = size
        self.buttons: List[Button] = []
    
    def add_button(self, button: Button) -> None:
        self.buttons.append(button)
    
class FormalShirt(Shirt):
    def add_button(self, button: Button) -> None:
        if button.fancy:
            self.buttons.append(button)
```

Same code in multiple places -> updating it requires updating in both places -> prone to typos and bugs

---

## Calling a superclass's method

Directly call `Shirt`'s `add_button()` from within `FormalShirt` using `super()`:
```python
class Shirt:
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.size = size
        self.buttons: List[Button] = []
    
    def add_button(self, button: Button) -> None:
        self.buttons.append(button)
    
class FormalShirt(Shirt):
    def add_button(self, button: Button) -> None:
        if button.fancy:
            super().add_button(button)
```

Any changes to `Shirt`'s `add_button()` propogate to `FormalShirt`.

---

## Calling a superclass's method

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.food: set[str] = {'tuna', 'chicken'}
    
    def knead(self) -> None:
        print('Kneading')
    
    def eat(self, food: str) -> None:
        if food in self.food:
            print(f'Eating {food}')

class Lion(Cat):
    def roar(self) -> None:
        print('Roaring')
    
    def eat(self, food: str) -> None:
        self.food |= {'zebra'}
        super().eat(food)
```

But there is an even more convenient way to handle this one...

---

## Calling a superclass's _constructor_

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.food = ['tuna', 'chicken']
    
    def knead(self) -> None:
        print('Kneading')
    
    def eat(self, food: str) -> None:
        if food in self.food:
            print(f'Eating {food}')

class Lion(Cat):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.food += ['zebra']

    def roar(self) -> None:
        print('Roaring')
```

</div>
<div>

- `eat()` method inherited from `Cat` works by default in `Lion`
- `self.food` is defined in `Cat`'s constructor, so we overwrite it with a new constructor in `Lion`...
  - one that executes `Cat`'s constructor first, and then adds `'zebra'` to `self.food`

</div>
</div>

## Every class is a subclass of `object`

These two class definitions are equivalent:

```python
class MyClass: pass

class MyClass(object): pass
```

This is why every class has a built-in `__str__()` method: they inherit it from `object`

---

## Every class is a subclass of `object`

`__eq__(self, other) -> bool` is also inherited from `object`

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

Before overwriting `__eq__()`:

```python
class Student():
    def __init__(self, 
            student_id: str, major: str
    ):
        self.id = student_id
        self.major = major
        self.courses: Set[str] = set()

s1 = Student('s1', 'CS')
s2 = Student('s1', 'CS')
print(s1 == s2)  # False
```

</div>
<div>

After overwriting `__eq__()`:
```python
class Student():
    def __init__(self,
            student_id: str, major: str
    ):
        self.id = student_id
        self._major = major
    
    def __eq__(
            self, other: object
    ) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(other, Student):
            raise TypeError
        return self.id == other.id

s1 = Student('s1', 'CS')
s2 = Student('s1', 'CS')
print(s1 == s2)  # True
```

</div>
</div>

## Poll: Why is this bad?

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.food: List[str] = ['tuna', 'chicken']
    
    def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(other, Cat):
            raise ValueError
        return other.name in self.food
```

1. It's possible for `cat_a` to equal `cat_b` today, but for `cat_a` to not be equal to `cat_b` tomorrow (with no code changes)
2. It's possible for `cat_a` to not equal itself
3. It's possible for `cat_a` to equal `cat_b`, and `cat_b` to not equal `cat_a`
4. All cats will be equal, making the `__eq__()` function useless

## UML (Unified Modeling Language) Diagrams

A UML diagram visually shows us the classes and their relationships in a program.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

<img width="440" height="444" alt="Cat UML" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01616e15-98ac-45f6-b86e-0394028173a7" />

</div>
<div>


This UML diagram says:
- class name: `Cat`
- `str` attribute called `name`
- method called `knead()`
- method called `eat(food: str)`

`+` indicates that a method or attribute is intended to be publicly available.
`-` (minus) indicates that it is not (two underscores `__`).

## The Liskov Subsitution Principle

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
<div>

# "If S is a subtype of T, then objects of T can be substituted with objects of S without altering any of expected functionality."

</div>
<div>

##### In other words:

## A member of the subclass can be used wherever a member of the superclass is required.

</div>
<div>

##### Example:
- you want coffee
- you receive an espresso
- espresso is a subclass of coffee
- you are satisfied because the coffee hierarchy follows the Liskov Substitution Principle

</div>
</div>

<!-- Breaking the Liskov Substitution Principle: a subclass overriding a method such that it doesn't accomplish the original goal anymore -->

#### May 7, 2025: TSA requires "Real ID"

<img width="517" height="504" alt="Real ID requirements" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94ee1149-56cb-4dd6-b4d4-7b99ca790a2e" />

https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/real-id/what-is-real-id/

---

## Poll: Which are true?

1. The Real ID requirements follow the Single Responsibility Principle because one object covers multiple uses (TSA and driving)
2. The Real ID requirements break the Single Responsibility Principle because the same object is used for multiple unrelated activities (TSA and driving)
3. The Real ID requirements follow the Liskov Substitution Principle because anywhere that the old ID is used, the new (more specific one) can be used instead
4. The Real ID requirements break the Liskov Substitution Principle because there are things that the Real ID can do that the old ID (less specific one) cannot
