# Abstract methods

##### We cannot instantiate a class that has an `@abstractmethod` (even inherited).

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_area(self) -> float:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_perimeter(self) -> float:
        pass

shape = Shape()  # TypeError
```

</div>
<div>

- Doing so will raise a `TypeError`.

- To instantiate a class that inherits a `@abstractmethod`, overwrite it with a **concrete** (non-abstract) method.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

## Poll: What happens?

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def make_sound(self) -> None:
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    pass

dog = Dog()
```

</div>
<div>

1. A `Dog` object is created successfully
2. A `TypeError` is raised because `Dog` doesn't implement `make_sound()`
3. `Dog.make_sound()` returns `None`
4. A warning is printed but `dog` is created

</div>
</div>

---

## Poll: Which is TRUE?

1. A class can only have one abstract method
2. You can instantiate an `ABC` if it has no abstract methods
3. Abstract methods cannot have parameters
4. `ABC` classes cannot have concrete (non-abstract) methods

---

## Poll: What is output?

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self) -> str:
        return "Starting..."

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self) -> str:
        return super().start() + " car engine"

c = Car()
print(c.start())
```

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

A) A TypeError is raised
B) "Starting..."

</div>
<div>

C) "Starting... car engine"
D) "car engine"

</div>
</div>

---

## Poll: How many abstract methods must a concrete (non-abstract) subclass overwrite?

1. At least one
2. Exactly one
3. All of them
4. None, they are optional

---

# Inheritance

1. A _subclass_ is a more specific version of a _superclass_.

2. The subclass _inherits_ all methods and attributes from the superclass.
-> Except those named with two underscores

3. The subclass can overwrite any inherited methods / attributes.

4. The subclass can add more methods / attributes.

---

## Calling a superclass's method (or constructor)

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.food = ['tuna', 'chicken']
    
    def knead(self) -> None:
        print('Kneading')
    
    def eat(self, food: str) -> None:
        if food in self.food:
            print(f'Eating {food}')

class Lion(Cat):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.food += ['zebra']

    def roar(self) -> None:
        print('Roaring')
```

</div>
<div>

- `eat()` method inherited from `Cat` works by default in `Lion`
- `self.food` is defined in `Cat`'s constructor, so we overwrite it with a new constructor in `Lion`...
  - one that executes `Cat`'s constructor first, and then adds `'zebra'` to `self.food` (which is inherited)

</div>
</div>

---

## Poll: What is output?

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand: str):
        self.brand = brand

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(
      self, brand: str, model: str):
        self.model = model

c = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
print(c.brand)
```

</div>
<div>

1. `Toyota`
2. `None`
3. An `AttributeError` is raised
4. `Camry`

</div>
</div>

### Poll: Which method call would return `"Rex makes a sound"`?

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.name} makes a sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name: str, breed: str):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed
    
    def speak(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.name} barks"

d = Dog("Rex", "Labrador")
```

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

A) `d.speak()`
B) `super().speak()`

</div>
<div>

C) `Animal.speak(d)`
D) `d.Animal.speak()`

</div>
</div>

## UML (Unified Modeling Language) Diagrams

A UML diagram visually shows us the classes and their relationships in a program.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

<img width="440" height="444" alt="Cat UML" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01616e15-98ac-45f6-b86e-0394028173a7" />

</div>
<div>


This UML diagram says:
- class name: `Cat`
- `str` attribute called `name`
- method called `knead()`
- method called `eat(food: str)`

`+` : intended to be publicly available
`-` : not public (two underscores `__`)


</div>
</div>

# UML Diagram: Subclass / Superclass Relationship

Arrow from subclass to superclass:
<img width="473" height="500" alt="Cat Lion Housecat UML" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3babba9f-2f03-4deb-88bd-716baa47cb5f" />

## Poll: Which statement is TRUE?

```
        Vehicle
           △
           |
      _____|_____
      |         |
    Car      Truck
```

1. `Vehicle` inherits from both `Car` and `Truck`
2. `Car` and `Truck` are superclasses of `Vehicle`
3. `Car` and `Truck` are subclasses of `Vehicle`
4. `Car` and `Truck` are sibling classes with no relationship

---

## Poll: If `Account` has a method `deposit()`, what can you infer about `SavingsAccount`?
```
    Account
      △
      |
SavingsAccount
```

1. SavingsAccount must override the deposit() method
2. SavingsAccount inherits the deposit() method
3. SavingsAccount cannot use the deposit() method
4. SavingsAccount must implement deposit() from scratch
