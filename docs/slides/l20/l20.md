# Interfaces and Abstract Classes
## Welcome back to CS 2100!
## Prof. Rasika Bhalerao

---

# New: Flashcard Decks!

## Students requested a way to review the syntax and concepts required for a homework assignment.

## Homework 4 flashcards are available in Pawtograder.

---

## Poll: Which of these would make a good superclass / subclass pair?
1. Rectangle / Square
2. Sophomore / Freshman
3. Mammal / Elephant
4. Building / Window

---

# Rectangle and Triangle are both Shapes

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
class Shape():
    def get_area(self) -> float:
        pass
    
    def get_perimeter(self) -> float:
        pass
```

## But we're unable to implement these methods in `Shape`

</div>
<div>

```python
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, 
        width: float, 
        height: float
    ) -> None:
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def get_area(self) -> float:
        return self.width * \
            self.height
    
    def get_perimeter(self) -> float:
        return 2 * \
            (self.width + self.height)
```

</div>
</div>

---

# Rectangle and Triangle are both Shapes

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
class Shape():
    def get_area(self) -> float:
        pass
    
    def get_perimeter(self) -> float:
        pass
```

## But we're unable to implement these methods in `Shape`

## So we leave them as _abstract methods_.

</div>
<div>

**Abstract method**: a method with no implementation

Two abstract methods in `Shape`:
- `get_area()`
- `get_perimeter()`

Implementation is left to the subclasses.

</div>
</div>

---

## Does leaving methods un-implemented make us uncomfortable?

```python
shape = Shape()
print(shape.get_area())  # None
```

## What if we instantiate a `Shape` and ask for its (nonexistent) area?

### (Or what if we forget to implement the abstract method in its subclass?)

# How embarassing. Let's prevent that.

---

# The `ABC` module

Prevents instantiating a class that has an abstract method (even an inherited one)

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_area(self) -> float:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_perimeter(self) -> float:
        pass

shape = Shape()  # TypeError
```

</div>
<div>

- To instantiate a class that inherits a method decorated with `@abstractmethod`, we must overwrite it with a **concrete** (non-abstract) method.

- If a subclass doesn't implement all abstract methods, the `ABC` module will raise a `TypeError` when you try to instantiate it.

<div>

1. pet1: Pet = Pet()

## Poll: Does this work?
```python
for pet in [Cat(), Dog(), Cat()]:
    pet.express_affection()
```
1. Yes
2. No
3. I don't know
4. I looked ahead in the online lecture notes and found the answer

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Pet(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def express_affection(self) -> None:
        pass

class Cat(Pet):
    def express_affection(self) -> None:
        self.make_biscuits()
    
    def make_biscuits(self) -> None:
        print('Making biscuits')

class Dog(Pet):
    def express_affection(self) -> None:
        self.slobber()
    
    def slobber(self) -> None:
        print('Slobbering')

for pet in [Cat(), Dog(), Cat()]:
    pet.express_affection()

</div>
<div>

# It works. Here's the output.

# Interfaces

**User interface:** describes the behavior without telling you how it's implemented

**Interface:** describes the behavior of a class without implementing its methods

#### In Python, an interface is an abstract class (`ABC`) where all methods are `@abstractmethod`

#### An interface is a **contract:** if a class wants to "implement" the interface, that class must implement each specified method.
- Different classes can implement the same methods in different ways
- Classes can also have additional methods which are not specified in the interface

---

## Poll: (Designing an interface) What should all classes which implement the interface `Cat` be able to do?
1. Sleep
2. Roar
3. Meow
4. Bark
5. Knead

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
class Cat(ABC): pass

class Roarable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def roar(self) -> None:
        pass

class Lion(Cat, Roarable):
    def roar(self) -> None:
        print('ROAR')

class AsiaticLion(Lion): pass

class HouseCat(Cat): pass

class Dragon(Roarable):
    def roar(self) -> None:
        print('GRRRR')

cacophony: List[Roarable] = list()
```

</div>
<div>

## Poll: Which types can be instantiated and put into the list `cacophony`?

1. Lion
2. AsiaticLion
3. HouseCat
4. Dragon
5. Roarable

# Interfaces vs abstract classes

**Interface:** a "contract" that specifies what a class should be able to do.

**Abstract class:** a class that happens to need abstract methods (because it is too non-specific).

---

## Interfaces vs abstract classes: controversy with the `ABC` module

- `ABC` module was originally designed to help with abstraction:
  - inheritance hierarchies where we happen to need abstract methods

- Using the `ABC` module to design interfaces:
  - is commonplace in modern Python
  - but some argue that that is not what it was originally designed for

#### The controversy:
- Interfaces serve different purposes than abstract superclasses.
- The `ABC` module was created for abstract superclasses, not interfaces.

## More controversy: using interfaces when Python uses [duck typing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4205130/what-is-duck-typing)

[**Duck Test:**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4205130/what-is-duck-typing) "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck."

- Python's types are not enforced
- We can pass a variable of any type to a function expecting arg of any type
- If the variable has the necessary methods / attributes to work in that context (to quack), great! **It's a duck.**

</div>
</div>

## Why are we teaching interfaces when they're controversial?

- It helps us to **detect errors early**, not while running the program
- We prioritize **readability**, and making contracts explicit through interfaces helps with **"self-documentation"**
- It helps us to **keep track of types' capabilities**, especially in large codebases
- When designing APIs for others to use, it helps **ensure that implementers implement all required methods**
- It **prepares students for future courses** where types and interfaces are fundamental concepts

---

## Python's beautiful alternative to interfaces: Contracts

- Interface using `ABC` is an explicit contract: classes must follow the rules (enforced)
  - Early error detection, readability, easier to follow, requires other implementors to follow our rules, teaches fundamental concepts

- Python's built-in contracts are followed by convention but not enforced
  - Includes things that interfaces cannot include (like specifying _what the methods should do_, rather than simply listing the methods that need to be implemented)

---

# A Python contract: `len()`

"Length protocol" / "size protocol":
- `def __len__(self) -> int` which returns a non-negative `int`
- this is what is returned by the `len()` function

```python
class Cat:
    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return 900
    
print(len(Cat()))  # 900
```

---

# A Python contract: `len()`

There is an interface in `ABC` which enforces that we implement `__len__()`:

```python
from collections.abc import Sized

class Cat(Sized):
    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return 900
    
print(len(Cat()))  # 900
```

Neglecting to implement `__len__()` (or having it return a negative number) will cause an error.

---

# A Python contract: the `in` operator

"Membership test protocol" / "containment protocol":
- When you use `in`, Python calls `__contains__()`
- Protocol works on its own, but often enforced using `collections.abc.Container`
```python
from collections.abc import Container

class Document(Container[str]):
    def __init__(self, text: str):
        self.words = text.split()

    def __contains__(self, word: object) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(word, str):
            raise TypeError
        return word in self.words

print('hi' in Document('hi this is mini'))  # True
print('cat' in Document('hi this is mini'))  # False
```
