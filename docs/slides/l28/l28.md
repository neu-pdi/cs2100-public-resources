## Poll: What's wrong with this recursive function?

```python
def find_max(nums: list[int], index: int = 0) -> int:
    """Returns the maximum of the numbers in nums, starting from the given index"""
    if index == len(nums) - 1:
        return nums[index]
    else:
        max_of_rest: int = find_max(nums, index)
        if nums[index] < max_of_rest:
            return max_of_rest
        else:
            return nums[index]
```
1. It's missing a base case
2. It's missing a recursive case
3. The recursive case doesn't progress towards the base case
4. It has an "off-by-one bug"

## You may have seen trees like this decision tree:

<img width="680" height="391" alt="Major decision tree" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9606628-aa61-4d8e-8fd5-7f28d38c0738" />

---

## Some tree terminology / rules

- Each _node_ may have data
- There is a _root_ node (the start)
- Each node points to any number of _child_ nodes
- Cycles are not permitted
- There are any number of _leaf_ nodes (node with no children)

Note: In computer science, we draw our trees with the root at the top and the leaves at the bottom.

## Binary Search Trees

**Binary Tree**: A tree in which each node has at most 2 children

The first and second child of a node are called the left and right child, respectively.

<br/>

**Binary Search Tree**: A binary tree in which each node's data is greater than everything in its left subtree and less than everything in its right subtree

## What's a Binary Search Tree good for?

Let's say I want to check for whether the tree contains 12. How do we do that?

What about searching for 11 (with the same BST)?

What about searching for 11 (with the same BST)?

Hey, this is more efficient than searching a list!
It's not as efficient as hashing, but it does make a pretty good set.
And it's more useful if you care about the order of things.

`sortedcontainers.SortedSet` stores elements using a Binary Search Tree

(`pip install sortedcontainers`)

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

```python
ss = SortedSet([3, 1, 4, 1, 5])
print(ss)  # SortedSet([1, 3, 4, 5])
ss.add(2)
print(ss)  # SortedSet([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

</div>
<div>

Corresponding `SortedDict`:
```python
sm = SortedDict({2: [1, 2, 3], 1: [0, 0, 0]})
print(sm)  # SortedDict({1: [0, 0, 0], 2: [1, 2, 3]})
```

</div>
</div>

---

| `set` | `sortedcontainers.SortedSet` |
| - | - |
| Stored as a hash table (list of lists)â€‹<br />Index of each element is calculated using `__hash__()` | Stored as a Binary Search Tree<br />Elements must implement Comparable protocol |
| Constant time to look up / add / remove | Logarithmic time to look up / add / remove |
| Use when care more about speed than order | Use when care more about order than speed |

---

## Poll: Which are true?

1. For a `SortedDict`, it is constant time to check whether it contains a key
2. For a `SortedDict`, it is constant time to check whether it contains a value
3. `set`s can store things which don't implement the Comparable protocol
4. `set`s can store things which aren't hashable
5. When we iterate over a `set`, the elements will be increasing in size
6. When we iterate over a `SortedSet` the elements will be increasing in size

---

Let's use recursion to search for an element in a `Tree`:

```python
class Tree(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, root_data: Optional[T] = None) -> None:
        if root_data is None:
            self.root: Optional[Node[T]] = None
        else:
            self.root = Node[T](root_data)
    
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return self.root.__str__()
    
    def __contains__(self, item: T) -> bool:
        return self.contains(item, self.root)
    
    def contains(self, item: T, node: Optional[Node[T]]) -> bool:
        if node is None:
            return False
        elif node.data == item:
            return True
        else:
            return self.contains(item, node.left) or self.contains(item, node.right)

tree: Tree[str] = Tree[str]('Entry way')

assert tree.root is not None
tree.root.left = Node[str]('Living room')

tree.root.left.right = Node[str]('Kitchen')

print('Kitchen' in tree)  # True
print('Bathroom' in tree)  # False
```

# That recursive backtracking algorithm is called **Depth-First Search**, since it explores "deep" in one area before moving on to other unexplored "shallow" places (closer to the root).


---

## Poll: This is pseudocode for a Depth-First Search on a graph that is not a tree (because it has cycles). What's a good base case?

```
DFS(node):
    Base case:
        ???
    Recursive case:
        For each child:
            Add child to explored nodes
            DFS(child)
```
1. If the node is in the set of explored nodes, do nothing
2. If the node is a leaf, add it to the set of explored nodes
3. If the node is `None`, do nothing
4. If the node is `None`, add it to the set of explored nodes

# 1. What is your main takeaway from today?

# 2. What would you like to revisit next time?
